Pooja,

- You showed a nice proof that you have all the necessary setup for python.

- You showed a nice proof that you have a GitHub account and that you added me as a
  collaborator.

- You provided a nice proof that you created a Kaggle account.


Overall a barely acceptable work:
- No problems solved at all  -16pts
- No $\LaTeX$


Peace,

- Dr. Pablo Rivas
